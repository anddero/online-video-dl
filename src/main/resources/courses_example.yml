documentation:
  - The only key that is scanned and considered in this file
  - is the "courses" key below.
  - The "courses" key can contain other arbitrary keys which
  - will guide how the resulting video files will be named.
  - The most important rule is that under each inner-most custom key,
  - the video links must be provided as an array and will have
  - postfixes "Video 1.mp4", "Video 2.mp4", etc appended to the
  - resulting file names automatically.
  - The nesting does not have to have the same depth in all
  - subsections. The way the program works is that it scans each
  - key and its subkeys recursively and individually, until it
  - reaches a list. Then it treats the list as video stream URLs
  - and uses the hierarchy of the keys under which this list lies,
  - to calculate the resulting file names.
  - Tested with HLS (.m3u8) and MPEG-DASH (.mpd) streams, but any
  - file formats work that are supported by `video_dl` which is
  - the underlying command-line tool used to fetch each video.
  - The hierarchy below will result in the following video
  - files.
